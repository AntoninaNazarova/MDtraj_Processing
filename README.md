# MDtraj_Processing

To run .ipynb file, the following input is required:
-.pdb of the topology
-.xtc files of the simulated trajectories

This GitHub repository hosts a collection of Python scripts I've developed, utilizing the MDTraj library for processing MD results of protein-ligand complex simulations. The goal is to produce images of the quality seen in Nature-quality publications, such as the one by Han, J., Zhang, J., Nazarova, A.L., et al., titled "Ligand and G-protein selectivity in the Îº-opioid receptor," published in Nature (volume 617, pages 417â€“425, 2023). Feel free to use these scripts if you're aiming to create similar high-quality graphics for your projects. ðŸ˜Š
